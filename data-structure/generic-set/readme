This program provides a generic set for Strings and Integers. The user can instantiate the set, add and remove elements, remove duplicates, and sort the elements either by the order they're stored, or by sorted (ascending/descending/alphabetical) order, using the toString() method.

The Set<T> class is built on top of a quad linked list structure, therefore allowing data access in both sorted and queued orders.
